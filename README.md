# Best-Ads-Optimisation-Using-UCB
This code analyzes 10 Ad sets and helps find the best ad set using the Upper Confidence Bound machine learning algorithm.

More on UCB here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/upper-confidence-bound-algorithm-in-reinforcement-learning/

## To Run
1) Export Ad sets from CSV file consists of 10 Ads.
2) Replace the data in Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv with current ads data.
3) Run: sudo python upper_confidence_bound.py 

## Ads Histogram for current Data
Clearly Ad: 4 is the winner and should have higher budget allocation.
